                <p>ICS security is a security framework that protects these systems against accidental or intentional risks. The SANS ICS Curricula provides hands-on training courses focused on Attacking and Defending ICS environments. These courses equip both security professionals and control system engineers with the knowledge and skills they need to safeguard our critical infrastructures..</p>
                <p class="light">Tremendous gains are being achieved in industrial applications by sharing and analyzing data, and preparation is critical because ICS incidents are occurring with increasing frequency and damaging systems.</p>
